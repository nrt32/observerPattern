# observerPattern
This project is to implement a optimized thread safe Observer Design Pattern. As a side product this implementation will also contain majority of the c++ good practices included.

# TODO :
1. Event class for the subjects to communicate with observers.
2. Removing expited weak_ptr's from the list of observers in subjects.
3. Add thread safety to all calls.
